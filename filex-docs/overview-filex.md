title: Understand FileX
description: FileX is a high-performance, file allocation table (FAT)-compatible file system that's fully integrated with ThreadX and available for all supported processors. Like ThreadX, FileX is designed to have a small footprint and high performance, making it ideal for today's deeply embedded applications that require file management operations. FileX supports most physical media, including RAM, USBX, SD CARD, and NAND/NOR flash memories via LevelX.

# Overview of FileX

FileX embedded file system is Eclipse ThreadX's advanced, industrial grade solution for Eclipse Foundation FAT file formats, designed specifically for deeply embedded, real-time, and IoT applications. FileX supports all of Eclipse Foundation's file formats, including FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32. FileX also offers optional fault tolerance and FLASH wear leveling via an add-on product called [LevelX](../levelx/index.md). All of this combined with a small footprint, fast execution, and superior ease-of-use, make FileX the ideal choice for the most demanding embedded IoT applications.
